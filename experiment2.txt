CMPM146 Assignment 3 (P3) Experiment 2 Analysis
Emmanuel Butor and Rammohan Ramanathan

Experiment Setup:
	- Player 1 will be mcts_modified
		- Referred to as Modified
	- Player 2 will be mcts_vanilla
		- Referred to as Vanilla
	- 3 tests will be run through p3_sim.py
		- Each test will perform 100 games
		- Each test will will evaluate how each MCTS performs with different node sizes
			- Modified and Vanilla will have the same node size each test
		- test 1 - 1000 nodes
		- test 2 - 100 nodes
		- test 3 - 500 nodes

Experiment Results:
	- Modified v.s. Vanilla both utilizing 1000 nodes
		- Modified won 88 games
		- Vanilla won 12 games
	- Modified v.s. Vanilla both utilizing 500 nodes
		- Modified won 84 games
		- Vanilla won 15 games
		- 1 Draw
	- Modified v.s. Vanilla both utilizing 100 nodes
		- Modified won 71 games
		- Vanilla won 29 games

Conclusion:
	At 3 varying node sizes Modified beat Vanilla every single time. 
	However as the node size increases, there are diminishing returns for the number of wins Modified gains over Vanilla.
	Even at values lower than 100, Modified still wins majority of the time.
	Though it is important to note that Modified is about 40% slower than Vanilla. Test was done measuring performance time for a single game against the rollout bot.
	
	An unrelated test:
	[Modified vs Rollout at 100 nodes] consistently outperformed [Vanilla vs Rollout at 100 nodes]
	[Modified vs Rollout at 1000 nodes] produced similar results to [Vanilla vs Rollout at 1000 nodes]
